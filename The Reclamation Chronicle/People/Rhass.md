## 📜 Biography

Rhass was born just before the Collapse and raised entirely aboard the Vigil Spire, never having set foot on a planetary surface until the reclamation of Velar Prime. His fascination with living systems developed early, dissecting hydroponic rot and designing nutrient-optimized algae cultures to feed the Exodus fleet.

Though not a charismatic leader, his brilliance in life science diagnostics has already saved multiple reclamation crews from biological contamination and famine. Rhass views science not as innovation—but as restoration.
