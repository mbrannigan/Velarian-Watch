## 📜 Biography

Rhassa emerged late during the Exodus, not from within the central fleet, but from one of the Outer Fragments—lost and presumed dead colonies that had splintered before the core systems fell. When she arrived at Vigil, she brought no ship, no crew—just a memory crystal and a heavily encrypted manifest of coordinates.

She never speaks of what happened in the Fragments. But her insight into fragmented governance structures and post-collapse psychology is unmatched. She has since become a crucial figure in stitching together the scattered remnants of the Velari into a unified Watch.

Though less experienced than others on the Council, Rhassa holds tremendous moral sway with the civilian population.
