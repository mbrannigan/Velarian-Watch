## 📜 Biography

> “I watched the stars fall once. I don't plan to watch again.”

Kashnaka was born aboard the _Verdiction_, one of the last surviving huskships of the Velarian Exodus. Her childhood was spent tracing stellar charts through failing interfaces and rerouting engine heat to warm oxygen recyclers. She rose through the helm ranks not by pedigree, but because she never once drifted off course—not even in the silence between systems.

By 28, she was Lead Navigator of the core fleet, guiding blind jumps through ion shrouds and debris clouds during the Reclamation’s darkest years. Her talent wasn’t just navigation—it was anticipation. She could smell a gravity mine two parsecs out. She was the one who first plotted the multi-vector migration route back to Vigil.

Kashnaka was promoted to Minister of Defense by unanimous Council vote. Her tactical brilliance and deeply rooted loyalty to the Watch made her the natural choice to oversee the rebirth of the Velarian military.

## 🪖 Personality & Doctrine

Kashnaka is curt, calculating, and deeply protective of those under her command. She mistrusts diplomacy that delays preparation and believes every day without contingency drills is a gift wasted.

Her preferred strategy is a combination of:
- High-evasion strike fleets
- Precision ambushes
- Strategic deception through sensor ghosting and feint movements

She has an old Exodus mantra etched into her quarters in shipplate alloy:

> _“To be ready is to remember. To remember is to return.”_

## 📘 Quotes

> “Show me a border, and I’ll show you who dies first if we’re wrong.”  
> “Scars make better maps than memory.”  
> “Defense isn’t a wall. It’s a question the enemy doesn’t survive answering.”
