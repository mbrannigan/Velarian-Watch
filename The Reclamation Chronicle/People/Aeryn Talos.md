## 📖 Biography
> *"When the old world fell, Aeryn Talos didn’t just survive—she remembered."*

Aeryn Talos was born aboard the drifting arkship **VSS Diligence**, decades after the fall of the Velar Ascendancy. The daughter of exiled navigators and survivalists, she grew up among derelict hulls, orbital decay, and whispered stories of worlds long lost.

Her early life was defined by silence—silent decks, silent stars, and the silent resentment of an empire abandoned. But Aeryn studied. Listened. Trained. She joined the **Reclamation Navy**, quickly distinguishing herself with her ability to command under pressure, draw insight from chaos, and rally fractured fleets with quiet intensity.

Her defining moment came during the **Battle of Vigil’s Gate**, where she led a strike wing to disable the orbital defense grid surrounding Velar Prime—once a crown jewel of the Velarian people, now a derelict husk patrolled by ancient war machines. She won not through overwhelming firepower, but through surgical tactics and asymmetric war doctrine inherited from rebel doctrines centuries old.

The planetary assembly named her **Warden of Vigil**, the first such title in the reconstituted government. She accepted with trademark restraint and immediately began organizing the Watch—military, civic, and philosophical orders devoted to ensuring the galaxy would never again catch them unprepared.
