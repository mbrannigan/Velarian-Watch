## 📖 Biography

> *“Every structure casts a shadow. I am that shadow.”*

Born during the Drift Era aboard the **VSS Fathomlight**, Caelen Vorr was raised among archivists and systems theorists who believed survival was secondary to meaning. He was taught not just how to keep records, but *why* memory must survive collapse.

Vorr’s role in the Reclamation of Vigil was decisive but subtle. While others debated orbital strikes, he studied the Custodian signal trees. His codework produced mimicry routines that pacified ancient defense grids long enough for Aeryn Talos’ team to act. The mission succeeded—because of war and because of memory.

He stood beside Talos during the founding of the Watch, not as a subordinate, but as a counterbalance. Where she forged order from steel, he traced its moral edges. When asked to assume a position of authority, he insisted on a title that reflected his function, not his ego: **The Mirror**.
