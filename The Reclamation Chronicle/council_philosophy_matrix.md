## ðŸ§  Council Dynamics & Decision Tendencies

This matrix reflects each council memberâ€™s current decision-making style. These stances should evolve in response to:

- ðŸ“ˆ Trait gains or level-ups  
- ðŸ§  Significant in-world experiences (e.g. failed projects, first contact, crisis)  
- ðŸ“‰ Negative outcomes (e.g. famine, loss of a colony)  
- ðŸŽ– Role shifts or internal promotions  

**ðŸŒ€ When any of the above occurs, revisit and re-roll or modify the memberâ€™s tendencies to reflect narrative change.**

|-------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Aeryn Talos | Vigilance, balance       | Unity vs unchecked expansion                | Synthesizes consensus, but errs toward caution when cohesion is at risk. |
| Kashnaka    | Tactical security         | Will challenge overextension and under-defended advances | Prefers preemptive military positioning and doctrine alignment. |
| Rhassa      | Political resilience      | Pushes back against instability, soft budgets | Advocates for unity, cohesion, and long-game resource sustainability. |
| Rhass       | Technological pragmatism  | Resists emotion-driven or low-return moves   | Prioritizes scalable, compounding benefit over short-term gain. |
| Caelen Vorr | Strategic architecture    | Balances long-view vision vs tactical input | Synthesizes opposing views but anchors direction with decisive framing. |
