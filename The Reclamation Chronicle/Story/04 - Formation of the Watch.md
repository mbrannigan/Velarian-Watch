2200.01.01 – Turn 1

(Aeryn Talos — Internal Log, Vigil Spire Command Deck | 0430 hrs Standard Time)

Command feels different when it’s real again. Not simulated. Not survival. Real. The air tastes of ozone and burnt silence. Power hums under my boots like a caged breath. Vigil is awake. I remember how it used to sound—how it died. There’s no protocol for resurrection. Just instinct and a willingness to be seen.

They’ll be arriving soon. Kashnaka, already pacing in the launch corridor. Rhassa will be early, quietly watching. Rhass will be last, distracted by something he can’t quite disprove. We’re not a council yet. Just survivors with matching uniforms. But today, we become something more.

---

I handpicked each of them—each a product of what we’ve lost and the tools we need to reclaim. They each bring something critical to the table, and each of them has a reason for being here, for being chosen.

**Kashnaka**, I trust her more than anyone else here. She was there during the Exodus, not by choice, but because she had no other path. A navigator, a tactician, a protector. She’s seen more than her share of battles—sometimes with only a star chart and a prayer to guide her. After the collapse of the Confederation, she became one of the few who understood the importance of _holding_ what we had left. She wasn’t just a strategist—she was the first to remind us that we didn’t need to conquer; we needed to survive. That’s why I made her **Minister of Defense**. We’ll need her sharp instincts in the days to come.

**Rhassa**, she’s a mystery to me, even now. She came from one of the Outer Fragments—a section of the Exodus fleet that was lost to time. She never speaks of what happened during those years. Some say she was part of a colony that fell apart, others say she was part of a resistance. What’s clear is that Rhassa is a woman of resilience, of quiet power. When she first boarded Vigil, she brought nothing with her but an encrypted data crystal, one she refused to let anyone examine. She’s a survivor, and she has a way of seeing what others don’t. Her mind sees patterns, solutions where others see obstacles. That’s why I made her **Minister of State**. She will help me rebuild the unity of the Velarian people, even if she won’t tell us how she does it.

**Rhass**, I don’t always understand him, but I know this much: he’s brilliant. A scientist, an engineer, but most of all—a thinker. He was born aboard Vigil and spent his life studying what remained. He’s always been fascinated by what the Confederation left behind. What we _could_ have been, what we _should_ have done. He’s a man of ideas, of visions—sometimes dangerous ones. But it’s precisely that mind I need if we’re going to push the limits of what’s possible and build the future of the Watch. That’s why he’s the **Head of Research**. The answers he finds will guide us in ways we can’t yet understand.

Today isn’t just about leadership. It’s about the heart of the Watch. These individuals, chosen not just for their expertise but for their willingness to lead when no one else could. They are the first we trust in the reclamation of our future. And together, we will rebuild what was lost.

As the log finishes, I look up, just as **Kashnaka** enters first, her boots echoing through the hall, the sound steady and determined. "Ready, Warden," she says, her expression hard to read.

**Rhassa** follows moments later, his usual calm demeanor intact. He's already scanning a nearby terminal, lost in thought, before acknowledging me with a simple nod.

Finally, **Rhass** enters, slightly late as always, his hands cradling a data pad with another set of complex equations he’s likely already solved in his head. He meets my eyes, giving a brief but sincere smile before returning to his quiet contemplation.

Today isn’t just about leadership. It’s about the heart of the Watch. These individuals, chosen not just for their expertise but for their willingness to lead when no one else could. They are the first we trust in the reclamation of our future. And together, we will rebuild what was lost.

The chamber was cold, still, lit by skylinescreen and the flickering birth of local satellites syncing to orbital control. No ceremonial horns, no flags. Just reclaimed steel, reinforced glass, and four chairs arranged around a long table with nothing written on it.  Kashnaka stood, arms crossed, projecting calm like a predator at rest. Rhassa offered a polite nod, the kind that said I’ve already reviewed the agenda twice. Rhass barely looked up, fingers ghosting over a portable reader projecting biome analytics of Velar Prime’s upper soil layer. Aeryn spoke first. “This is not a restoration. It’s a beginning.”  There was silence. Then Kashnaka said, “Do we call it the Watch officially? Or just keep pretending it isn’t already moving?” Rhassa gave the faintest smile. “It moves, yes. But we need more than motion. We need reason.”  Rhass didn’t look up. “We need stability. I have nutrient loss projections showing—”  Aeryn raised a hand, calm and deliberate. “You’re all right. But none of it matters if we hesitate. Vigil is no longer sleeping. The Armada is fueled. The eyes of the void are open. And we will be what we were meant to be—if we choose it.” She leaned forward. “Let it be recorded: as of this hour, by mutual will of surviving leadership and under the light of Velar reclaimed, we reconstitute the Watch. All decisions made from this point forward serve one purpose—preserve, protect, and remember.”  There was a pause. Kashnaka nodded. “Finally.”  Rhassa said softly, “Then let’s begin.” Rhass blinked once. “We’ll need seeds. And caution.”  The console lit up as the first data packets from the outer sensors came online. Unknown anomalies. Energy signatures. Traces of something older than their exile.  Aeryn looked at the star map. “Caelen will be here soon.”
