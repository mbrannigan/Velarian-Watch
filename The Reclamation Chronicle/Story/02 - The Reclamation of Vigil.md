# 🔱 The Reclamation of Vigil

> *“We found the sky again—but it did not know our names.”*

Three centuries had passed since the Fall. The Velarian Reclamation Fleet had become less a fleet and more a myth—quiet, cold, and relentless. Systems were mapped, signals decoded, derelicts salvaged—but no world was called home.

That changed when a probe—long presumed lost—returned with coordinates from the Deneb system.

## 🛰️ Rediscovery

Velar Prime.

The cradle of civilization. Once scorched, irradiated, and abandoned during the Sundering Silence, it now showed signs of stabilizing. Green bands reemerged near the equator. Atmosphere: breathable. Orbitals: partially intact.

But defenses remained.

Automated sentries in orbit continued their endless quarantine routines. Drone wings patrolled in dead silence. Entry was impossible without triggering ancient fail-safes.

It was **Aeryn Talos**—Fleet Strategist and survivor of the Drift—who proposed a reclamation plan. *Operation Shardveil*.

She envisioned a multi-layered assault: disrupt defense protocols using false incursion signals while infiltrating the orbital grid with a precision strike team. The operation was bold. Some called it reckless.

**Caelen Vorr**, Memory-Architect and civic advisor, did not disagree. But he offered a refinement: using recovered fragments of Custodian sub-languages, he helped engineer mimicry patterns to confuse the orbital systems, reducing the need for bloodshed.

Their strategies aligned. One from fire. One from reflection.

## 🌍 Planetfall

The plan succeeded.

Vigil’s orbital defenses were lulled into reorientation. The infiltration team severed primary grid control. Touchdown commenced.

The cities were shattered. The biomes twisted. But beneath the ruins, in the catacombs of the Citadel Core, they found it—the **Primary Memory Vault**.

Untouched. Still running. Every record, every protocol, every encoded testimony of the Velar Ascendancy… intact.

And with it, responsibility.

# 🧭 Prelude to Founding

With the world reclaimed, the question emerged: *What now?*

Some among the fleet called for rebuilding the old empire. Others demanded a fortress-state, isolationist and absolute. A few wanted to scatter—mission complete.

But in the command spire, Talos and Vorr stood apart.

> “This is not the end of our exile,” Vorr said. “It is the beginning of our remembering.”

> “We do not rebuild the Ascendancy,” Talos said. “We build something that cannot fall like it did.”

The night before the first assembly, Talos transmitted a single-line message to the fleet:

> *“No banners. No crowns. Only vigilance.”*
