## 🌌 Star System Context

- **Home:** Vigil (Energy: 5, Minerals: 2, Research: 2)
- **Star Type:** Blue
- **Neighbors:**
  - **Brustam:** West, precursor signal selected for first mission and defense-oriented colonization
  - **Tavänder:** Southeast, anomalous readings
  - Third Lane: North fork (unknown)

---

## 📖 Narrative Notes

> *“The Watch does not awaken to conquest, but remembrance. From the fractured stones of Velar Prime to the silence beyond Tavänder, we rise—not to dominate, but to endure. Brustam will be our first step—a spark in the dark, and the edge of our vigilance.”*

> Strategos Vorr ordered research to begin on Zero-G Laboratories, Ground Defense Planning, and Powered Exoskeletons. The Watch prioritizes infrastructure and long-term capability over immediate defensive upgrades. Rhass directs all research streams from the Vigil Spire.

## 🧾 Turn Summary

### ✅ Major Decisions This Turn
* 🛡️ The Council of the Watch formally established
* 🛰️ Rhass assigned as science officer to VSS Fylima the Lawful
* 🌌 Brustam selected as first survey and colonization target
* 📅 Official start of the After Watch (AW) calendar era
* 🎖️ Aeryn Talos granted trait: Champion of the People
* ⚔️ Kashnaka granted trait: Gale-Speed
* 🧠 Research initiated: Zero-G Labs, Ground Defense Planning, Powered Exoskeletons
- 🧠 Discovery tradition adopted (To Boldly Go)
* 🔄 Priority shift to **science vessel** construction before **colony ship**.

###🧩 Outstanding Items / To-Do Next Turn
* Determine **science vessel** leader and initiate its mission.
* Begin **colony ship** construction after gathering sufficient resources (estimated 360 days).
* **Evaluate early remedies** for food and consumer goods deficits.
* **Assign General** for ground forces once colony ship timeline is clearer.
* Monitor Tavändar and Third Lane for emergent signals.
