# 🌌 Galactic Context: 1st Cycle of the Reclamation

> Extract from the Memory Keepers’ compiled briefings, Cycle 1 of the Reclamation Era

In the early years following the return to Vigil, the Velarian Watch reentered a galaxy much changed by time, entropy, and neglect. The starways were fractured, littered with the echoes of lesser empires and shattered ambitions. What follows is a situational briefing compiled by the Office of the Warden of Vigil, establishing the known configuration of the stars at the beginning of the Reclamation.

## 🛸 Known Galactic State

- **Spiral Galaxy**, medium in scope—structured with arms conducive to chokepoints and layered defense.
- **Twelve emergent powers** currently project influence across the stars. Their exact ideologies and intentions remain under classification.
- **One advanced civilization**—likely a military hegemon or ideological monolith—was detected early via spectral drift and long-range scans.
- **One Fallen Empire** remains in a decayed orbit of influence. The Memory Keepers suggest it may be a remnant of the old order.

## 🔍 Reclamation Conditions

- **Habitability** across known worlds has declined, with terraformed systems largely lost or in ruin (0.75x baseline).
- **Primitive civilizations** are more common than anticipated, supporting hypotheses of a galactic regression during the Interregnum.
- **Relic travel systems** such as **gateways** and **wormholes** remain partially active, yet unstable.

---

## 📜 Strategic Constraints

- **Galactic unrest** is low; hostility is minimal—but potential for asymmetric threats remains.
- **Empire placement** appears random; early intel reveals no hostile neighbors near Vigil.
- **Marauder activity** is confirmed, reinforcing the Warden’s recommendation to limit early naval expansion beyond core systems.

---

## 🕰 Temporal Markers

- **Mid-Game Analysis** begins at Cycle Year 2300
- **End-Game Risks** project from Cycle Year 2400 forward
- **Projected Apex Year:** 2500 (subject to alteration based on emergent threats or ascension)

## 🧭 Notes from the Warden's Office

Aeryn Talos has reaffirmed that the Watch is not to become the empire it once was, but something more vigilant, more precise. She has authorized limited exploration teams under Caelen Vorr’s leadership to chart the spiral arms, reclaim memory shards, and assess political movements.

All Watch personnel are advised to maintain containment protocols, refrain from ideological contamination of primitives, and observe the Mirror.
