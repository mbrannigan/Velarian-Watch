# 🧭 NEW THREAD INSTRUCTIONS — The Reclamation Chronicle

To restore full game context when starting a new thread, paste the following message into the new conversation:

---

**Reload my Stellaris project context from `game_context.md` and the latest turn file in `/turns/`. I’m playing as Caelen Vorr, and you're Aeryn Talos. This is the Reclamation Chronicle.**

---

## ✅ Project Files to Keep Updated

- `game_context.md` — Canonical master record of the empire
- `/turns/turn_XX_YYYY_MM_DD.md` — Most recent turn snapshot
- `/People/` — Character profiles (e.g., Aeryn, Caelen, Rhass, Rhassa, Kashnaka)
- `/Story/` — Chapter logs
- (Optional) `/Worlds/`, `/Systems/`, `/Doctrine/` — Extended lore

## 🗂 Recommended File Naming

- Turn files: `turn_01_2200_01_01.md`, `turn_02_2200_02_01.md`, etc.
- Character files: `Aeryn Talos.md`, `Kashnaka.md`, etc.
- Keep latest turn and game context synced after major events or decisions.

## 📝 Optional: Include a Root-Level README

You can maintain a short summary file with:
- Current date (AW)
- Current explored systems / targets
- Council roles and traits
- Known threats or objectives

---

## 🔁 What This Enables

With just the `game_context.md` + latest turn + your note, your full campaign state can be restored instantly.
