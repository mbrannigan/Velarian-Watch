## ðŸŽ¯ Gameplay Intent

This setup is designed for:
- Narrative-rich storytelling
- Reclamation arcs and asymmetric early growth
- A late-blooming power with ideological depth
- Slow, meaningful diplomatic and technological development

The Velarian Watch begins in obscurity and isolation, slowly rebuilding from the ruins of Vigil. Galaxy settings reflect this emphasis on discipline, long memory, and defensive adaptability.
