# ðŸŒŒ Velarian Watch Chronicle

**A narrative-driven Stellaris lore archive** chronicling the fall, reclamation, and rebirth of the Velarian people. This project is a living history of the Velarian Watchâ€”a civilization forged from collapse, rebuilt through discipline, memory, and vigilance.

---

## ðŸ“– Overview

The Chronicle is divided into three narrative arcs:

### 1. **The Fall**
- Describes the collapse of the original Velarian Confederation.
- Sets the stage for exile, loss, and the long silence of Vigil.

### 2. **The Reclamation of Vigil**
- Centuries later, Aeryn Talos and Caelen Vorr begin the return.
- Rebuilding begins amidst derelict orbitals and fading stars.

### 3. **The Birth of the Watch**
- Establishes the doctrines, civics, and leadership structure of the Velarian Watch.
- Introduction of *The Mirror*, *Warden of Vigil*, and the rise of a new civic order.
